Whats the best way to learn coding
-Practice daily
\n will addd new line
-example kaushal\nRupatheti will print kaushal
                                       Rpakheti
Indentation or spaces are really important
cant write int in front of variables
Anything inside "" is a datatype also "type" function gives the data type
Implicit type casting is  done by the system only but explicit is done by external human
Head over to ascii.co.uk/art for dofferent ascii arts
\ can be used to escape the useful symbol next to it. Example: print('welcome user, what\'s your name') this will treat 's in what's as a part of symbol
Randomisation
    DO WATCH sudo random number generator - khan academy

python Modles:
    when writing a code if it becomes too long which leads to the problem of ununderstandable codes and it is than seperated into differet modules
    where eaach module is responsible for different fuctionalities
    Different programmers can be working on different modules in a single project

For loop
    A for loop lets you repeat a block of code for each item in a list (or any collection).

where to use for loop and where to use while loop
        for loop is useful when you want to iterate on something and you need to do something with each thing
        while loop is to carry out something until some condition is matched and no need to do anything with the iterated value
        in for loop you setup how many times the loop is going to run
        in while loop you keep iterating until the condition is mathed. So it is more dangerous because if your condition never matches than the loop tends to become an infinite loop
        

Docstrings 
    used to create a litte documentation in our function as we are coding along
